Arnold (1973) described several generations of a Vermont and New York kindred demonstrating multiple areas of necrosis in the diaphyses of the large tubular bones. The radiographic appearance of this skeletal condition resembled radiation osteitis, a highly premalignant condition; however, no source of radiation exposure was found in this family. Medullary fibrosarcoma, an uncommon bone tumor, was noted in 4 of the 12 affected members. Death had occurred from widespread metastases at ages varying from 23 to 48 years. Occurrence of fibrosarcoma in idiopathic bone infarcts (Furey et al., 1960) and in an infarct in a caisson worker (Dorfman et al., 1966) has been reported. Camacho-Vanegas et al. (2012) noted that 2 affected male individuals in the family reported by Arnold (1973) died of heart disease in their early forties without other known risk factors, and suggested that this may be a manifestation of the disorder.   Hardcastle et al. (1986) gave follow-up information on the original American family and reported 2 other families, one English and the other Australian. They could find no reports of any hereditary or acquired condition similar to that in these 3 families. They suggested that the malignant change should be labeled 'malignant fibrous histiocytoma' rather than fibrosarcoma because the tumors were markedly aggressive. The malignancy occurred generally in the second to fifth decades of life. They defined the skeletal dysplasia as a diaphyseal medullary stenosis with overlying cortical bone thickening. The occurrence of fracture with minimal trauma was emphasized.   Norton et al. (1996) reported a 19-year-old boy who presented with a nontender mass on the left tibia that proved to be a pleiomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. Radiographs of the affected leg showed extensive diaphyseal cortical thickening and a medullary permeative pattern in the diaphysis. Radiographs of the patient's mother and maternal grandmother showed a similar bony dysplasia, with areas of infarction and medullary sclerosis. The lower extremities were more affected than the upper extremities in all 3 cases. Family history was significant for the death of the maternal great-grandmother at age 32 from 'metastatic osteosarcoma.' Norton et al. (1996) commented on the similarities to the families reported by Hardcastle et al. (1986) and noted that the malignant fibrous histiocytomas in this condition presumably begin at the sites of infarction within the affected bone.   Henry et al. (1958) reported a Canadian family in which 6 men had delayed healing of fractures of the long bones and later developed myopathy. Mehta et al. (2006) provided follow-up on the family reported by Henry et al. (1958); features of 8 living and 8 deceased family members with the disorder were evaluated. In this family, fractures preceded myopathy: the average age at onset of limb-girdle myopathy was 31 years, whereas that of fractures was 24 years. Fractures were primarily of the long bones of the lower limbs and were associated with poor healing and osteomyelitis, leading to amputation in some cases. Serum creatine kinase was mildly increased, and alkaline phosphatase was normal. Radiographs showed coarse trabeculation, patchy sclerosis, cortical thickening, and narrowing of the medullary cavities of the long bones. The findings were not consistent with Paget disease (602080). Muscle biopsies showed nonspecific myopathic changes without necrotic fibers, regenerating fibers, inflammatory infiltrates, or structural abnormalities. Many affected family members had premature graying of the hair and soft, thin skin, and 3 affected members had a clotting disorder.
