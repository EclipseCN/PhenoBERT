Ha-Vinh et al. (2004) described a child with Bruck syndrome who was the offspring of healthy nonconsanguineous Turkish parents. At birth, pterygia were present at the left elbow and at both knees, and extension of these joints was limited. Contractures were also present at the wrists, and there were bilateral clubfeet. Bilateral inguinal hernias were present. A fracture of the left arm was recognized immediately after birth, and the boy had 2 more fractures in the first 3 months of life. His urine contained high levels of hydroxyproline but low levels of collagen crosslinks degradation products.   Van der Slot et al. (2003) stated that they were unaware of any phenotypic differences between Bruck syndromes 1 and 2.
