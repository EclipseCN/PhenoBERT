Higgins et al. (2000) used a private genealogic database to reconstruct the relationships among 32 individuals from 5 nuclear families in a single pedigree in which 10 members had nonsyndromic mental retardation. Standard IQ ranged from 50 to 70, consistent with mild mental retardation. IQ scores were lower in males than females. Developmental milestones were mildly delayed. There were no dysmorphic or autistic features. The kindred was consanguineous, and the evidence clearly indicated autosomal recessive inheritance. Several branches traced back to a founder couple who arrived in America in 1849 from a town in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of Germany.
