Engelking (1920) and Wieland (1932) separately reported a family in which 11 members of 3 generations had erythrocytosis. In some, the abnormality was noted in childhood. A patient reported by Auerbach et al. (1958) was again reported by Cassileth and Hyman (1966) with family study.   Ly et al. (1983) reported 5 persons in 3 generations with familial erythrocytosis associated with decreased serum erythropoietin. Hemoglobin function and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate were normal.   Prchal et al. (1985) reported a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of erythrocytosis. Affected members had increased serum red blood cell mass, increased hemoglobin, and decreased EPO levels. Arterial oxygen levels and blood oxygen affinity were normal. In vitro erythroid colony forming units showed significantly increased stimulation by low levels of EPO.   Quiesser et al. (1988) described erythrocytosis in 7 members of a family in 4 generations with male-to-male transmission. The propositus was first diagnosed at age 26 years. He had headaches and marked plethora. Erythropoietin levels were not elevated. The disorder was characterized in middle age in other members of the family by hypertension, cardiovascular and thromboembolic phenomena, and abnormal bleeding. The proband was treated successfully with repeated venous phlebotomies.   Juvonen et al. (1991) reported a large Finnish family with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis. In vitro studies showed hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to EPO. The erythrocytosis had not had any obvious effect on the health or life span of the affected individuals. In fact, many reached an advanced age and 1 won several Olympic gold medals and world championships in endurance sports.
