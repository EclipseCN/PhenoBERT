Jiang et al. (2010) reported a Chinese family with an autosomal dominant form of spinocerebellar ataxia. There was a broad range of age at onset, particularly among females. Those with onset of ataxia before age 40 years showed cognitive impairment, and brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy. All affected males were infertile and had azoospermia with testicular atrophy. Testicular biopsy from 1 male showed complete absence of germ cells and progenitors.
