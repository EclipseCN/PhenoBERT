Reiff et al. (2014) reported a consanguineous kindred of Yemeni origin in which 7 individuals had intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. Detailed clinical features were available for 3 patients. Each had delayed psychomotor development, with walking at age 1.5 years, and moderate to severe cognitive impairment; 1 had autistic features. Two had controlled seizures. Brain imaging performed on 1 patient was normal. Dysmorphic features included flat occiput, large eyes, depressed nasal bridge, short, upturned nose, long philtrum, thin lips, and incomplete syndactyly. One patient had a cleft uvula and submucosal cleft palate.   Bernkopf et al. (2014) reported 2 unrelated consanguineous families with autosomal recessive mental retardation. Four Austrian sibs had delayed psychomotor development apparent after the first year of life but maintained a high level of functioning, with independent activities of daily living. The patients also had flat feet and 3 had prominent maxillae, a feature also present in a milder form in the mother. None had seizures. Brain imaging of 1 patient showed possibly increased volume of the subcallosal gray matter and decreased delineation of the basal ganglia. Two Pakistani sisters had similar features; the brain MRI of 1 sister showed decreased delineation of the basal ganglia region. Bernkopf et al. (2014) noted that the neurologic phenotype was milder in their patients compared to that reported by Reiff et al. (2014).
