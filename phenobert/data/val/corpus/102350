Beillard et al. (2005) described 7 individuals with bi-acromial dimples without associated malformation. In 5 of the 7, the diagnosis was fortuitous, suggesting that these dimples represent a common and likely underdiagnosed condition. Although the dimples are thought to become less conspicuous or even disappear with age, one of their patients was a 66-year-old man who had dimples since early infancy.
