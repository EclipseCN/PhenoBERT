Grebe (1952, 1955) described the disorder in 7- and 11-year-old sisters, offspring of a consanguineous mating. (The name is pronounced GRAY-beh.) The same disorder was found in Brazil by Quelce-Salgado (1964). In these cases, all 4 limbs are markedly shortened and end in tiny digits. The trunk and head are normal. A case with childhood and adult radiographic studies was presented by Scott (1969).   Romeo et al. (1977) described 2 patients, each with an entity similar to but distinct from Grebe chondrodysplasia. Teebi et al. (1986) reviewed the adult case reported by Romeo et al. (1977) and added the case of an infant who, in their view, has the same disorder, a condition separate from Grebe chondrodysplasia. Meera Khan and Khan (1982) described 6 cases distributed in 3 sibships in 3 generations of an inbred kindred in India. The parents were consanguineous in each of the 3 sibships and the entire pedigree gave incontrovertible support to autosomal recessive inheritance. No radiologic or other abnormality was found in heterozygotes by Meera Khan and Khan (1982) or by Garcia-Castro and Perez-Comas (1975), although Quelce-Salgado (1968) mentioned that x-ray studies of the parents of one of his patients showed absence of some phalanges of the toes and changes in other phalanges, as well as talipes equinovarus, polydactyly, and double halluces in more remote relatives.   Curtis (1986) called attention to a report of an inbred Miao Chinese kindred with 6 affected persons. The authors suggested that heterozygotes may have mild skeletal anomalies of the hands and feet. Curtis (1986) concluded that the family that she reported (Kumar et al., 1984) may have been an example of brachydactyly as a heterozygous manifestation of Grebe chondrodysplasia. Feng et al. (1985) reported an inbred kindred living in an isolated village of Yunnan province in China. Six of 13 children in 2 related sibships were affected. They stated that 65 affected individuals, including these 6, have been reported. In the 2 patients they studied in detail, the head and trunk were normal in marked contrast to severely malformed limbs. The anomalies progressed in severity distally in the limbs. The fingers and toes were replaced by small, bud-like or knob-like protrusions. Both patients were polydactylous. The skull and vertebral column were normal roentgenographically.   Costa et al. (1998) reported clinical and radiological findings in 10 affected individuals originating from Bahia, Brazil. The phenotype was characterized by a normal axial skeleton and severely shortened and deformed limbs, with a proximal-distal gradient of severity. The humeri and femora were relatively normal, the radii/ulnae and tibiae/fibulae were short and deformed, carpal and tarsal bones were fused, and several metacarpal and metatarsal bones were absent. The proximal and middle phalanges of the fingers and toes were invariably absent, while the distal phalanges were present. Postaxial polydactyly was found in several affected individuals. Several joints of the carpus, tarsus, hand, and foot were absent. Heterozygotes presented with a variety of skeletal manifestations, including polydactyly, brachydactyly, hallux valgus, and metatarsus adductus.
