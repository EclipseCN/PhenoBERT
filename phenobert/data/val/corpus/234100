Hallermann (1948) and Streiff (1950) reported patients with dyscephaly, a 'bird-like' face, congenital cataracts, and microphthalmia. Francois (1958) identified similar reported cases with the additional features of hypotrichosis, skin atrophy, dental anomalies, and short stature.   Dental features were discussed by Caspersen and Warburg (1968).   Steele and Bass (1970) emphasized the lack of mandibular angle and hypoplasia of the clavicles and ribs.   Warburg (1971) emphasized that the diagnosis is doubtful in the absence of cataract or microphthalmia.   Cohen (1991) warned of the potential complications related to the narrow upper airway and suggested that snoring and/or daytime hypersomnolence are indications for sleep studies. Robinow (1991) also emphasized the risks of problems with upper airway obstruction in HSS, particularly in the neonatal period and in infancy. Obstruction may result from small nares and glossoptosis secondary to micrognathia and these may lead to cor pulmonale. Salbert et al. (1991) pointed to tracheomalacia as a complication of HSS that can lead to chronic respiratory insufficiency. Such resulted in biventricular cardiac failure and death at the age of 6 months.   Harrod and Friedman (1991) described a woman with HSS who had a son with congenital cataracts. Furthermore, her mother and a sister also had congenital cataracts. Harrod and Friedman (1991) were perplexed by these observations. The cataracts in the patient with HSS were no more severe than those in first-degree relatives who had only cataracts.   Radiologic findings in 5 cases and in the literature were reviewed by Christian et al. (1991).   Nosologic overlap with oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD; 164200) was discussed by Spaepen et al. (1991).   Congenital heart defects are rare in HSS. Imaizumi et al. (1994) reported what they believed to be the fourth case associated with congenital heart defect in a boy who had ventricular septal defects.   Mirshekari and Safar (2004) described a 26-year-old woman with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. She had hypotrichosis, bird-like facies, atrophy of the skin (especially on the nose), abnormal dentition, and congenital bilateral cataracts, but was not dwarfed and did not have mental retardation.   - Clinical Variability   Dennis et al. (1995) described a family in which a male infant who died neonatally and a female fetus who died at 29 weeks of gestation had an identical condition resembling Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. Long bones were slender with a few fractures, the skull was underossified, and the face was characteristic of HSS. Bilateral cataracts were identified in the male. They regarded the condition as a severe and lethal form of HSS.
