Vuopala et al. (1995) described 15 infants from 11 Finnish families with a phenotype of lethal arthrogryposis and anterior horn motor neuron loss. The clinical presentation was the fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) with multiple contractures and facial anomalies. The phenotype was uniform with low-set ears, hypoplastic jaw, short neck, and contractures. Malpositions in the extremities were moderate, distal, and inwardly spiral. The mean gestational age was 34 weeks, with 8 infants being born at term. Most of the cases were perinatal lethal; 3 infants were stillborn, 5 died within 1 hour, 6 died within a few days, and 1 survived for 20 days. Skeletal muscles were affected in all infants, but the severity of pathologic findings varied. A tibialis muscle sample from one infant showed severe neurogenic atrophy. Muscle spindles were shaped normally with a normal number and differentiation of intrafusal fibers. The size and shape of the spinal cord at different levels were normal but the anterior horn motor neurons were degenerated and diminished in number. The families came from different parts of Finland, and no geographic clustering was observed.   Vuopala et al. (1995) differentiated LAAHD from the lethal congenital contracture syndrome (LCCS1; 253310), also prevalent in Finland. LCCS is always fatal during the fetal period, presenting with severe hydrops and intrauterine growth retardation. The spinal cord is macroscopically thinned because of an early reduction of the anterior horn and a paucity of anterior horn cells. The skeletal muscles are extremely hypoplastic, even difficult to locate. Infants with LAAHD survive longer than those with LCCS, and when present, hydrops and intrauterine growth retardation are mild and the macroscopic findings of the central nervous system and skeletal muscles are normal. Furthermore, birthplaces of ancestors of affected individuals do not show clustering in the northeast part of Finland, as is the case with LCCS.
