To gain insight into the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) by investigating the ocular manifestations of this disease.

Using standard histologic techniques, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we described the ocular pathologic findings of a 34-year-old woman who died from complications of NF2.

We identified 3 types of NF2-associated lesions: juvenile posterior subcapsular cataracts, epiretinal membranes, and an intrascleral schwannoma.

Our analysis indicated that dysplastic lens cells accumulate just anterior to the posterior lens capsule in juvenile posterior subcapsular cataracts and that dysplastic Müller cells may be a major component of NF2-associated epiretinal membranes. Clinical Relevance Our findings suggest that a subset of glial cells with epithelial features (Schwann cells, ependymal cells, and Müller cells) may be particularly sensitive to loss of the NF2 gene. Understanding the molecular basis for this sensitivity may lead to novel strategies for treating NF2.
